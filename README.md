# Cancer Data Classification Project
This repository contains the code developed for the final project of my Data Mining class, completed in December 2021. The project focuses on classification algorithms.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to explore and implement various dimensionality reduction techniques and classification methods. Specifically, the project investigates methods for reducing the dimensionality of feature vectors and different approaches to classification. The dataset used for training and testing the models consists of features extracted from cancer samples.

## Contents
-	Cancer_Classification.py: Python script containing the main code for cancer data classification.
-	data_cancer.xlsx: Excel file containing the dataset used for training and testing.

## Dataset
The dataset (data_cancer.xlsx) contains various features extracted from cancer samples, along with corresponding labels indicating the presence or absence of cancer.
